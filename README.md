# Go-Redis

**Go-Redis** is a lightweight Redis database implementation written in **Golang** from scratch. This project is not an original idea but was built as a learning exercise to better understand Golang and Redis internals. It replicates key Redis functionalities and serves as a practical exploration of database design and systems programming.

## Features

- **Command Handlers**: Implements core Redis commands.
- **Data Persistence**: Supports **Append-Only File (AOF)** for data durability.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Go
- **Persistence**: AOF (Append-Only File)

## Purpose of the Project

This project is intended as a learning exercise and was inspired by Redis. It was built to deepen understanding of:
- Golang programming principles
- Database design concepts
- Redis internal architecture
